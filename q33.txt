33. How are the following codes different from one another?
(a) fp = open("file.txt", 'r')
fp.read()
(b) fp=open("file.txt", 'r')

Answer: 
(a) is opening the file as 'fp' and then calling the .read() method which then outputs the content of the txt file
while (b) is only opening the file and not performing any operations
